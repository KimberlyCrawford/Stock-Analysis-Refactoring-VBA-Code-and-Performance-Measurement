# Stock-Analysis-Refactoring-VBA-Code-and-Performance-Measurement

## Overview of Project
Visual Basic Applications (VBA) Code was written for a stock analysis of 12 different stocks. The code was then refactored to compare VBS script runtime and measure performance if a dataset included the entire stock market over the last few years.

### Purpose
A stock analysis was performed to provide a client with all financial options for investing in types of alternative energy such as hydro, wind, geothermal and/or bio. The stock analysis was performed using Visual Basic Applications (macros) within Microsoft Excel for 2017 and 2018 stock data.  

The purpose of this analysis was to use VBA code to compare stock performance between 2017 and 2018 for a small number of stocks (12). 
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

The total daily volume (the total number of shares traded throughout the day that measures how actively a stock is traded) and yearly return (the percentage increase or decrease in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year) for each stock was calculated.   

A flexible macro was created for running multiple stocks. The financial analyst wanted to determine the correct macro to use, and then figuring out how to run the macro. To make life easier for the end-users of our code like Steve, we can create buttons in the worksheet.

In the future, Steve may want to perform his analysis on larger datasets, and he wants to know how fast his VBA code will compile the results. To help Steve, we need to add a script that will calculate how long the code takes to execute and output the elapsed time in a message box.


## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

You should see that DQ traded 107,873,900 shares in 2018. DAQO's stock price dropped over 63% in 2018; therefore, the financial advisor will need to offer some better stocks to his new clients.

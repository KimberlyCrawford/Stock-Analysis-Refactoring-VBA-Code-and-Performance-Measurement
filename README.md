# Stock-Analysis-Refactoring-VBA-Code-and-Performance-Measurement

## Overview of Project
Visual Basic Applications (macros) within Microsoft Excel were created to analyze 2017 and 2018 stock performance for 12 different tickers of alternative energy. The original VBA script was refactored to compare VBS script runtime and measure performance if a larger dataset will be analyzed.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to share analysis results of the original VBA script versus refactoring the script when it comes to runtime speed. Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code is listed in the Summary section below. 

## Results: 
Below are execution results for original and refactored script:

## Summary

- Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code: Refactoring code makes the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, and improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. It does not add more functionality and can be risky when working with large datasets. 
- The above pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script was not determined until I get my code to work.
